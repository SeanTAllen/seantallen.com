How Did I Get Here? Building Confidence in a Distributed Stream Processor

## Abstract

Sean T. Allen talks about the various means his team has come up with to create repeatable tests that allow them to start trusting that their system will give correct results, discussing how to combine repeatable programmatic fault injection, message tracing, and auditing to create a trustworthy system.
