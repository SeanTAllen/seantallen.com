## Interview overview

Mike's Synposis:

> In this conversation I speak with Sylvan Clebsch and Sean Allen about the Pony Programming Language. We start first understanding their early careers learning programming and what led to the development of the Pony Programming Language. Towards the middle of the conversation, I also am fortunate to have them each do a code walk through the Pony Patterns tutorial, teaching me more about the language and the design. This was an incredibly insightful conversation, and the first such on this channel to have two guest speakers.  So sit back, relax, and listen to a great conversation about a language that I believe has a lot of power!
